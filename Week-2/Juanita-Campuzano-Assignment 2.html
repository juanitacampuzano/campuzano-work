            <h4>What tone do you want for this site's written content?</h4>
            <p>
            The tone I want for this website is a reflection of my personality. I want the vibe to be clean, classy, and modernistic. The audience should feel welcomed and relaxed with the monochromatic colors chosen and soft music played in the background.

            </h5>
            <p>
            The primary content on this website is to have a scrolling homepage that is sublte but yet impressive. That welcomes and hooks the audience in to dig deeper. The homepage will be, in a way, a summary of what they are about to encounter when they dig deeper. It will have a menu, my logo, a self-taken image, then you scroll down and see the three main sections, and at the end a contact me button.
